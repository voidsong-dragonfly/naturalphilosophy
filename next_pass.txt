14. Revisit Mushroom Island, possibly? How much can I really do for the biome?

1.3.0:
1. Dead trees
2. Roots to some trees (jungle)
3. Revisit Mushroom Island, possibly? How much can I really do for the biome?

2.0.0:
1. Pale Garden up to Natural Philosophy standards
    Pale garden is already pretty good, add more moss and more grass?
    Don't want to make the trees too tall, or else breaking creaking hearts might become much harder
    Add some ground vegetation maybe?
2. Nether biomes?
3. Changes to cave biomes to make them look better?
    Glowing light blue mushrooms for Deep Dark
    Water color changes for Lush Caves if their water is not already green-ish
4. Add some custom biomes to the game?
    Fill out existing missing portions of the biome spread (cold plains, move a few biomes further apart, etc)

Don't want to duplicate things PVJ does because they do them just fine. Work on things PVJ does NOT do instead
