0. Mushrooms! Removed these on first pass by mistake
1. Berries! These need to be in more biomes
2. Moss
3. Fallen trees
4. Dead trees
5. Roots to some trees (jungle)
6. More block variations in jungle surface rules
7. Possibly some floor decorations (sticks, small rocks)
8. Anything else from PVJ I miss because it does a lot of the same things this mod does
