2.0.0:
1. Pale Garden up to Natural Philosophy standards
    Pale garden is already pretty good, add more moss and more grass?
    Don't want to make the trees too tall, or else breaking creaking hearts might become much harder
    Add some ground vegetation maybe?
2. Nether biomes?
    PVJ: Cindercane, glowcap, crimson & warped nettles,
3. Anything else from PVJ I miss because it does a lot of the same things this mod does
      Muddy bones, tropical fish, bones & seashells?, pink vines, bogged remains?
4. Changes to cave biomes to make them look better?
    Glowing light blue mushrooms for Deep Dark

TODO: Moss, Bedrock water colors
