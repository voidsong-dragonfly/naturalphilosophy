BETTERDEFAULTBIOMES
 - Cattails, rocks, other biome decorations
 - Better shaped swamp trees (structure >_>)
 - Giant mushrooms in swamps
BIOME MAKEOVER
 - New special tree (Ancient Oak) in Dark Oak forests
     - Tree has several branches a la Fancy trunk placer, but tufted leaves a la dark oak
 - Mineral fissure with new minerals in dark forests
 - Structure reworks (Badlands, Dark Forest)
 - 2x new Swamp tree, one with "fancy" branching trunk placer, one with straight but rooted placer. both have lumps of leaves, no known foliage placer
 - New blocks (reeds, cattails, hanging branches/moss, Saguaro, Mushroom Foliage)
 - Fossils in Badlands
BLOOMINGNATURE
 - Trees in Snowy Plains, with similar-to random-removed spruce foliage placer leaves, straight trunks. Also snowy taiga, but some lower trunks
 - Birch trees are tall and thin-leaved, with aspens among them in yellow in similar foliage
 - 2x2 tall dark oak + roots trunk placer, random removed leaves + cherry or dark oak or acacia foliage placer baobas in Savannas
 - Roots on dark oak trees + tall + more branches
 - Acacia leaf placer + fancy trunk placer + vines on swamp trees
 - Floating leaves block, dripleaf, cattails, reeds in swamps
ARBORIA
 - Standing and fallen dead trees, some of which use partial stripping on logs
 - Acacia-like brown mushrooms in places
 - Roots roots roots roots
 - Cherry leaves + fancy + mangrove roots for some trees in swamps
BLOOMING BIOSPHERE
 - Apply "badlands" surface rule to other biomes, incl. desert and savanna
 - Mangrove roots + small cherry foliage on swamp oaks + cherry trunk placer
 - Some mangroves (small ones) using Cherry placer??
TERRALITH
 - Use slabs to make steps look better (stone)
 - Check out "pine" foliage placer, probably has some good stuff for trees, & add it to some mixed biomes
 - Bigger mushrooms like trees
 - Chunk-distributed blocks are a good way to do fairly performant cliffs without surface rule problems
ECOTONES
 - Cherry leaf placer for small bushes works surprisingly well
 - Dead standing trees without stripped blocks, look worse than ones with partial stripping
 - Changed biome sky colors are intensely atmospheric
 - Mangrove roots on swamp trees + minimal foliage
WILDNATURE
 - Mixed tree shapes within the same biome and tree type make for gorgeous vistas
 - Highly variable grass colors
REGIONS UNEXPLORED
 - Windswept grass blocks lean to one side in plains and prairies
 - Pine trees in pine barrens have a section of stripped bark on their bottom 3-4 blocks of log
 - Hanging moss in bayou biomes on trees with roots on every tree, but using swamp oak placer
 - Small dead stunted trees atop marsh with randomized water and grass blocks, short/tall grass atop
 - Elephant ear and other water-loving plants commonly decorate old growth bayou, incl. willow shrubs
 - Overgrown stones for underground cave biomes
SWAMPIER SWAMPS
 - Cattail blocks with actual heads atop stems made of panes of grasslike blocks, along with large and small lilypads decorate the water
 - Either cherry or fancy trunk placer, or jungle trunk additions? Combined with roots and acacia like foliage placer make for cypress like trees
