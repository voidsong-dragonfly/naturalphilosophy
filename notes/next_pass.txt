Unknown Timeline:
1. Revisit Mushroom Island, possibly? More volcanic, hotsprings, basaltic mineral sands, the lot
2. More tree shape changes/decorators
    Roots on some trees, such as jungle and large spruce/pine?
    Dead trees in some biomes? (WILL need custom placers in some cases to look good, I think)
    Changes to tree shapes to make them feel more alive? This may make a greater departure from Vanilla minecraft than I want
    A branch decorator to make Redwood-esque trees look better?
3. Rocks or more intelligent water features?
4. Revisit tide pools with custom feature?
5. Termite mounds in Savanna biomes? - These are a custom BoP feature, check feasibility? Formations like the rock ones?


2.0.0:
1. Nether biomes?
    Nether dirt around lava lakes? Sinuous Weed? Other things from Primal Core?
    Other Nether plants? Unsure. Revamp normal Nether Wastes biome to be a bit less wasteland?
    Possibly add soul sandstone? or at least when Quark is there, do that?
2. Changes to cave biomes to make them look better?
    ✓ Water color changes for Lush Caves (greenish) and Deep Darp (deep blue-black inky)
    ✓ Ferns in lush caves, as well as increased changes of Glow Lichen and lilypads
    ✓ More particles in cave biomes? Spore blossom, ash in deep dark, etc?
    ✓ Mushrooms in Dripstone Caves
    ✓ Minor vegetation tweaks in Lush Caves
    ✓ Lots more glow lichen in every biome, specifically in large patches
    Smooth basalt mixed with deepslate around lava pools

    Water & lava features, if I can get them working

3.0.0
1. Pale Garden up to Natural Philosophy standards
    Pale garden is already pretty good, add more moss and more grass?
    Don't want to make the trees too tall, or else breaking creaking hearts might become much harder
    Add some ground vegetation maybe?
2. Add some custom biomes to the game?
    Fill out existing missing portions of the biome spread (cold plains, move a few biomes further apart, etc)



Don't want to duplicate things PVJ does because they do them just fine. Work on things PVJ does NOT do instead
